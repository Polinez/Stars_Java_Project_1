# Stars_Java_Project_1
This is the first semestral project for the Winter Semester of the Java Programming class. Exercises provided by [Dr. Przemys≈Çaw Juszczuk](http://www.pjuszczuk.pl/info/)

## Description
The project involves building a Java-based application that serves as a comprehensive database for managing celestial objects, specifically stars. The application allows users to:

- Add new stars with relevant details.
- Delete existing entries from the database.
- Save data persistently to ensure no information is lost.
- Manage and edit star records to maintain an accurate and up-to-date database.
  
This project emphasizes the practical application of Java programming concepts such as object-oriented design, data structures, and file handling, while also fostering a deeper appreciation for astronomical data organization.
